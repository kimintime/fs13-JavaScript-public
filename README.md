# JavaScript Assignment

## JavaScript Excersises

Exercise solutions can be found in the index.js, with the exception of exercise 4, which is in its own countries.js. 
ES6 syntax is new to me, I had an excellent JavaScript teacher, but he had a more fundamental approach, and when I'm pressed for time, it's one I fall back on, which you'll see in countries.js. 

With the exception of exercise 4, they all stumped me in their own ways. For example, of course I can iterate through an array, but had never seen setTimeout before. I can parse a string and compare values, but how do you switch day, month, and year, when two numbers can meet the same conditions? This was the first time approaching (outside of React projects) an array by mapping, and it still feels odd to say 'not month', but you have to force the number switch somehow.

In exercise 3, the time difference assignment, again I've done that before, but this is new syntax, new approach, and it's all a lot to remember, though the process for it is straightforward enough, as is generating folder names in exercise 5.

Exercise 6 is where I fall down the most, and needed help. I barely have experience constructing and using classes in Java. It was a typical quickl end-of-term lesson, so approaching it now was tricky. I understand well that you're constructing a class Book that has its attributes, but it's always the constructor that throws me. It always feels like you're defining it again. And then at the end of the instructions, basically do it again. It just seems like going around the elbow to get to the knee, and I'm not any less convinced or less confused by why you'd do it, by this assignment. 

But, I got through it, and maybe one day I'll be tackling projects large enough where it makes sense.

## Restcountries App

The original instructions for this website said to use a grid system, so I used bootstrap. Time was of the essence, and I like bootstrap, for nice responsive grid-building, and a library full of options. There's a little bit of JQuery, but just for the scroll animations.

The page can display all countries, or can search for countries matching a user-input. For example, searching 'China' results in three results. The user can scroll through the results, and can click-through for more information on that country.

### How to use
Simply hit enter (or click the search icon) to show all countries. Click on the red arrow icon to scroll back to top at anytime.

To learn more about a country, click on that country's flag, or the 'More' button. It will scroll automatically to display that information. If you want to close that display, simply click the 'x' button to the left of the flag.

You can start a new search at anytime, no need to close country results, or refresh the page.

These results are based on the information available at https://restcountries.com.
